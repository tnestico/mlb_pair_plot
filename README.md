#### About
This Streamlit app retrieves MLB  Pitching Data for a selected pitcher from the MLB Stats API and is accessed using my [MLB Stats API Scraper](https://github.com/tnestico/mlb_scraper).
The app outputs the pitcher's data into a pair plot to illustrate the data. 
It can also display data for games currently in progress.
